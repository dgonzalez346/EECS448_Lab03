        <p>This adorable unfortunate looking cat is Lil Bub. Bub was diagnosed with a rare bone condition
          called osteopetrosis. After achieving some amount of internet celebrity from her looks, her owner was able
          to get effective treatment and she has made a remarkable recovery. Her owner has used her fame to help raise
          funds for various charities. One such example is "Lil BUB's Big FUND" for the ASPCA, helping raise over
          $300,000 for animals in need.
